# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM, FBProphet and ARIMA Model
Stock market being highly volatile, there is a huge amount of uncertainty and risk associated with them. For a good and successful
investment, many investors are keen in knowing the future situation of the stock market. Good and effective prediction systems
for stock market help traders, investors, and analyst by providing supportive information like the future direction of the stock
market. Here we are presenting three innovative method to predict the future closing prices of stocks using combination of deep
learning approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Facebook prophet and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) time series model to predict the future closing prices of stocks.
